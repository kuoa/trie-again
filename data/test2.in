                          LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL.

The first authentic mention of Lichfield occurs in Bede’s Ecclesiastical
History, where it is alluded to as the See of an Anglo-Saxon Bishop. The
name is of Saxon origin, but its etymology has been much disputed. In
the Saxon Chronicle the word is written _Licetfeld_; in Bede,
_Lyccetfelth_ and _Licitfeld_. Some etymologists derive its
signification from _leccian_, to water (and it is well known to have
abounded in numerous lakes and pools); others, from the verb _licean_ or
_lician_, to like, or to be agreeable, and therefore make it to signify
Pleasant Field. It has however been more frequently allowed to be
derived from _lic_, a dead body, and consequently as signifying
_cadaverum campus_, the Field of Dead Bodies. This derivation is
supported by a prevailing tradition, of the martyrdom of a thousand
British Christians on this spot, at the time of the persecution (A. D.
303) under Dioclesian, when Maximian was governor of Britain.

It is certain that the present diocese of Lichfield and Coventry,
anciently formed a part of the kingdom of Mercia, which, being conquered
by (the _Christian King_) Oswy, introduced the Christian faith into this
powerful kingdom of the Saxon Heptarchy. He made Lichfield an episcopal
See, by appointing Diuma, a Scotsman, the first Bishop, A. D. 656. After
a succession of three others, the famous Ceadda, or Chad, was raised to
the Bishopric A. D. 667. Bede informs us, that “he had built himself an
habitation not far removed from the church; wherein he was wont to pray,
and read with a few, that is, seven or eight, of the brethren, as often
as he had any spare time from the labour and ministry of the word.”

From this period, little is known of the history of the See till after
the Norman Conquest, when at the National Council held in London, A. D.
1075, it was determined to remove the See of Lichfield to Chester, which
was done by Peter (the first bishop appointed by William the Conqueror),
who went by the appellation of Bishop of Chester and Lichfield. Robert
de Lymesey was his successor, and removed the See to Coventry, having
obtained from the King, the custody of that Abbey (originally founded by
Canute); this edifice having been restored and greatly enriched by
Leofric, Earl of Hereford, and his celebrated wife Lady Godiva. Robert
Peeke, chaplain to Henry the First, was consecrated to this See, A. D.
1117, and was succeeded, 1128, by Roger de Clinton, who was a liberal
benefactor both to the city and Cathedral church of Lichfield. He is
said to have rebuilt great part at the latter, to have increased the
number of Prebendaries, and to have appointed the first Canons. De
Clinton restored the See to Lichfield, and styled himself Bishop of
Lichfield and Coventry. Until the establishment of Chester as a separate
See, A. D. 1542, the succeeding bishops were indifferently called
Bishops of Lichfield, Coventry, and Chester, having an episcopal
residence at each place. Coventry and Lichfield was the usual
designation till Bishop Hacket, on the restoration of the monarchy,
placed Lichfield before Coventry, as a compliment to the loyalty of the
former place. Walter de Langton succeeded to the See in 1295, and did
much benefit to the city, forming streets, causeways, &c.; he augmented
the income of the Vicars, expended 2000_l._ on a shrine for St. Chad,
and rebuilt the Bishop’s Palace, giving the old episcopal house to the
Vicars Choral.

In the time of Henry the Eighth, the Cathedral became a prey to
depredation; its ornaments, statues, shrines, and all other valuable
articles were converted to the use of the crown, with the exception of
the shrine of St. Ceadda; this was saved by the intercession of the
Bishop, Rowland Lea, who obtained it from the King. This prelate
earnestly endeavoured to save the monastery of Coventry, and its fine
church, from spoliation, but in this his labour was fruitless, and they
were entirely demolished.

Little of interest occurs afterwards in the historical details of
Lichfield, till the commencement of the civil wars. In 1642, a troop was
raised for King Charles by Sir Richard Dyott, Kt.: during this time the
Close sustained three sieges, by which the Cathedral was greatly
injured. Preparations to considerable extent were made, 1643, to defend
the Close against Lord Brooke, and three thousand troops. This nobleman
was a zealous opposer of episcopacy, and had determined on the complete
destruction of the Cathedral; on his _approach_ to Lichfield he prayed
that he might be annihilated if his cause were unjust; on his _return_
from placing his artillery, he was shot by a brace of bullets,
discharged by a deaf and dumb gentleman, of the name of Dyott, who had
watched Lord Brooke’s motions from the top of the cathedral. Lord
Brooke’s body was removed to Warwick to be buried with his ancestors;
the armour worn by him on this fatal day, and his doublet stained with
blood, are in the armoury at Warwick Castle. The gun with which he was
killed remains in possession of the Dyott family, resident near
Lichfield.

Notwithstanding the check given to the rebels by the death of their
leader, the garrison could not long stand the siege, and were
constrained to yield to the Parliamentary forces. This was the first
cathedral which surrendered to them, and every species of havoc and
profanation was committed by these miscreants. The soldiers belonging to
the King’s party were imprisoned in the Cathedral three days and four
nights without food, except what could privately be obtained, and the
inclemency of the season obliged them to convert the seats and desks
into fuel. At this period the venerable pile became one scene of
desolation, the centre spire was battered down, the costly monuments
destroyed, and amongst others, that of Lord Paget, sculptured in Italy
at the enormous expense of 700_l._ Dugdale says, “courts of guard were
kept in the aisles; they broke up the pavement, every day hunted a cat
with hounds throughout the Church, delighting themselves in the echo
from the goodly vaulted roof, and to add to their wickedness, brought a
calf into it wrapt in linen, carried it to the font, sprinkled it with
water, and gave it a name in scorn and derision of that holy sacrament,
Baptism; and when Prince Rupert recovered that Church by force, Colonel
Russel, the governor, carried away the communion-plate and linen, with
whatsoever else was of value.”

The Close was retaken by Prince Rupert in 1643, and Colonel Hawey Bagot
was appointed Governor of the garrison; he had the honour of
entertaining Charles the First, after the battle of Naseby, when his
majesty left Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and slept at Governor Bagot’s, in
Lichfield, on the 15th of June 1645; this unfortunate monarch twice
afterwards revisited this city; but short was its period of
tranquillity, for in 1646, the Close was again taken by the
Parliamentary forces, under Sir William Brereton, and its walls
dismantled. In 1651, by authority of the Rump Parliament, men were
employed to strip off the lead from the roof of the Cathedral, and break
in pieces the Bells[1]. It may not be uninteresting to remark on the
heavy afflictions, or violent deaths, suffered by many of the spoliators
of the Church of those days; among others, Colonel Danvers who stripped
the roof, and Pickings who demolished the bells, met with untimely ends.

We find that although the building was in this dilapidated state, its
ministers did not neglect their duties, and Ashmole has the following
memorandum. “This morning Mr. Rawlings of Lichfield told me, that the
vicars of the Cathedral had entered the Chapter-house, and there said
service; that this, with the Vestry, was the only place in the church
that had a roof to shelter them.” On the Restoration, Dr. John Hacket
was happily appointed prelate: he found the church little better than a
heap of ruins, but, zealous in the cause of religion, he immediately set
to work with an activity rarely equalled. The morning after his arrival,
he employed his own coach horses to remove the rubbish, and took the
most vigorous measures to obtain assistance; petitioning from house to
house for pecuniary aid, and being himself a liberal benefactor. By his
unwearied diligence and munificence, the Cathedral in the space of eight
years had nearly regained its original splendour, and was re-consecrated
in 1669. The intrepid character of this admirable man may be shown by
the following anecdote.—Hacket was preaching in London, during the
persecution of the established Church, and although the Liturgy was
proscribed, under a severe penalty, he continued the use of it; at
length, an armed sergeant and trooper were sent to the church to compel
his obedience, but he, with a firm voice and unintimidated manner, read
the service as he was wont to do; and when the soldiers, placing a
pistol at his head, threatened him with instant death, he calmly
replied, “Soldiers, I am doing my duty, do you do yours!” then with a
voice equally composed, he resumed the prayers. The soldiers, awe-struck
by his pious courage, left the church in astonishment!

From Bishop Hacket’s time, the Cathedral underwent little alteration
till the year 1788, when the building being acknowledged to be in a very
dilapidated state, subscriptions were raised to repair and renovate it.
Under the direction of Mr. Wyatt, the external structure was put in good
order, and the internal decorations restored and embellished. The beauty
and magnificence of the edifice has since been greatly enhanced, by the
addition of some painted windows, from the dissolved Abbey of
Herckenrode in Germany: this valuable purchase was obtained by the Dean
and Chapter, through the liberality of the late Sir Brooke Boothby, who
made the acquisition when travelling on the Continent, for the small sum
of 200_l._, and generously transferred to them his bargain, estimated at
10,000_l._ These windows were painted at the period when the art had
attained its highest degree of perfection, and are considered by
connoisseurs as very valuable and choice specimens. Several modern
windows of superior merit, have also been inserted, by the present Dean,
Dr. Woodhouse, and others interested in the embellishment of the
venerable pile. The large window at the west, which had been totally
destroyed during the civil wars, and restored by James the Second when
Duke of York, has been filled with painted glass, from a legacy of Dr.
Addenbroke, who died Dean of this Cathedral, in 1776.

Although this Cathedral cannot compete in size and magnificence with
York and some others, in point of elegance it is inferior to none, and
its light and beautiful architecture is the theme of universal
admiration. The building is in form of a cross, having a large spire at
the intersection of the cross, and two smaller ones at the west end; the
pyramidal form of the western façade, enriched with highly wrought
decorations and tracery, is eminently beautiful; neither must the centre
porch be forgotten, being no less worthy of notice. The external length
of the church is 400 feet, and the breadth in the transept 187 feet. The
Nave and Aisles are good specimens of the simple yet exquisite taste of
the architecture of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; the
clustered columns, delicately moulded arches, and vaulted roof, impress
the beholder with a solemn and pleasing effect. Amongst the numerous
monuments, we must give the first place to that of the Cathedral’s
greatest benefactor, the good and pious Bishop Hacket: it consists of a
recumbent figure, and at the head is engraved the following appropriate
inscription; “I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, till I have found
out a place for the temple of the Lord.” But the monument which attracts
the eager attention of all admirers of the sculptorial art, is that
erected to the memory of the two Miss Robinsons; it is considered a
_chef-d’œuvre_ of Chantrey’s, and certainly has rarely been equalled for
beauty of design and workmanship. The remains of many celebrated
characters are recorded within these walls—that colossus of literature,
Dr. Johnson, justly the pride and boast of Lichfield: Lady Mary Wortley
Montague, who so greatly benefited mankind by the introduction of the
art of Inoculation. Gilbert Walmesley, Dr. Smalbroke, Dean Addison,
David Garrick, and Andrew Newton, who founded and endowed the noble
institution in the Close, for the widows and orphans of Clergy; for this
purpose, he gave, by will and donation, the sum of forty thousand
pounds.

The Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, was in early times of very great
extent; it is now much more limited, but contains the whole county of
Stafford (except Brome and Clent, which belong to Worcester), all
Derbyshire, the greater part of Warwickshire, and nearly half of
Shropshire. It has the Archdeaconries of Salop, Coventry, Stafford and
Derby. In the reign of King John, permission was granted to the Bishop
of Lichfield and Coventry to build a castle at Eccleshall, and this has
generally been, as it now is, the residence of the Bishop. There is also
a palace in Lichfield belonging to the See; the present one was erected
in 1687, by Bishop Wood, on the ground occupied by the garden of
Langton’s Palace (of which there are no remains), and was built in
compliance with an order from Archbishop Sancroft, as compensation for
damage committed upon property belonging to the See.

Lichfield being situated on the road between London and Liverpool (now
so much the line of communication with our sister country), is much
frequented by travellers; and few places are more interesting to the
lover of literature, having been either the natal spot, or home, of so
many distinguished for learned attainments. Every one capable of
appreciating the profound wisdom and moral energy of Johnson, must feel
a reverence and respect for the place where he first drew breath. Thomas
Newton, Bishop of Bristol, brother to Andrew Newton, whom we have
already mentioned, and the learned author of _Dissertations on the
Prophecies_, was a native of this city; as was also that famous
virtuoso, Elias Ashmole, the contributor of a valuable collection of
curiosities and MSS. to the University of Oxford, now assembled in the
Ashmolean Museum. Here was the paternal residence of that elegant
scholar, Addison; and in addition to the names already brought forward,
Lichfield could boast amongst its inhabitants the eccentric James Day,
author of _Sandford and Merton_, Mr. and Miss Edgeworth, Dr. Darwin, of
botanical celebrity, and several others of highly esteemed intellectual
powers.

[Illustration: WOODCROFT HOUSE, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.]




                            WOODCROFT HOUSE,


Of which we furnish a view from the pencil of Mr. Blore, is situated in
the parish of Etton, in Northamptonshire, about four miles from the city
of Peterborough. This building well deserves notice as an early and
perfect specimen of English domestic architecture. The form of the
windows is peculiar to the time of the first two Edwards, and the
character of the mouldings evidently points out that period, as the date
of its erection. The masonry is remarkably well executed, and the
mouldings beautifully worked; those forming the finish of the Tower,
over the entrance, are distinguished by a boldness rarely to be met
with. Originally, this must have been a place of some strength; it was
surrounded by water, excepting at the western approach, and the walls
are four feet in thickness. Though nothing remains of an embattled
parapet, there can be little doubt but that it possessed such provision
for defence, and that in this, as in other respects, it partook of the
character of the mansion-houses of the age.

The round bastion at the north end, represented in the drawing, is that
portion of the building to which an interesting historical incident is
attached; one of those events, which are the melancholy, and certain
fruits of anarchy and civil war.

Dr. Michael Hudson, who is styled by Wood, “an understanding and sober
person, and of great fidelity,” was, from his sincerity, called by King
Charles the First, his “plain-dealing Chaplain.” When the troubles of
that period commenced, Hudson, like some others of his profession, left
his benefice, under an impression that his monarch demanded his personal
aid; and King Charles having, as we are told, “an especial respect for
his signal loyalty and courage,” intrusted him with some important
secrets, as regarded his own proceedings. Hudson proved himself a
courageous soldier, but, being apprehended by the Parliamentary forces,
he suffered a tedious confinement. Escaping from his prison in London,
he joined a body of royalists, who had fled to Woodcroft House. When
attacked there by the Parliamentary forces, Hudson, with some of his
bravest soldiers, went up to the battlements, where they defended
themselves for some time. At length they yielded, upon the promise of
quarter; but when the rebels were admitted, they broke their engagement.
Hudson was forced over the battlements, and clung to one of the stone
spouts represented in the drawing. His hands being either actually cut
off, or severely hacked and bruised by the sabres of the soldiers, he
quitted his hold and fell into the moat underneath, desiring only to
reach the land and die there; but this miserable boon was denied him,
as, in attempting to reach the bank, he was knocked on the head with the
but-end of a musket, and drowned[2].

May we never, by God’s blessing, witness a recurrence of the scenes
which were presented at this eventful period of our history! Our great
dramatic poet, who showed his patriotism, by always giving to his
countrymen the wisest counsel, and encouraging correct sentiments
respecting justice and good government, thus beautifully describes a
kingdom, restored to the blessings of internal tranquillity.

           No more shall trenching war channel her fields,
           Nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs
           Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
           Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
           _All of one nature, of one substance bred_,
           Did lately meet in the intestine shock
           And furious close of civil butchery,
           Shall now, in mutual, well-beseeming ranks,
           March all one way; and be no more oppos’d
           _Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies_;
           The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
           No more shall cut his master.—_Henry IV._, Part I.
                                                        H. M.




                          SYMBOLICAL WRITING.


It would seem that the earliest of all written language consisted of
actual drawings of the forms of animals or things; rudely sketched,
indeed, by the hands of our rude forefathers, but sufficiently plain to
mark the object designed. This mode appears the more natural, because
the representation of sounds, which express the names of things, by
certain characters or alphabets, which is the mode now most extensively
in use, must necessarily require some previous concert between two
parties, the one of whom suggests, and the other agrees, that a
particular mark or form on paper shall be the symbol for a particular
sound. But if we suppose a savage separated from his friend, and wishing
to communicate with him, without having had this previous consultation,
and supposing that he has lent his distant acquaintance some articles of
furniture, such as his bow and arrows, or his knife, which he is anxious
to have returned, without the knowledge of his messenger, it seems
highly probable, that his first impulse would be to make a rude sketch
of these articles, and transmit the impression to his friend. Were the
latter an acute man he would probably understand the allusion; and, were
he not intelligent enough for this purpose, it is clear he would not be
nearly sufficiently so to comprehend the symbols to denote sounds. So
that the simplicity of this mode of writing might suggest the
probability of its being the first resorted to, without alluding to the
hieroglyphics yet remaining on the Egyptian tombs, which, from our want
of acquaintance with the manners, customs, and general objects with
which the Egyptians were conversant, are very difficult to decipher, if
we may judge from the learning expended in explaining them. As a modern
specimen of this kind of writing, it may not be uninteresting to
describe a letter which M. Martinez received from an inhabitant of the
Caroline Islands, in the Eastern Ocean. The following is the drawing of
the letter alluded to, and the description is taken from FREYCINET and
ARAGO’S _Voyage_.

[Illustration]

“This was written to M. Martinez, at Rotta, who had commissioned a Tamor
of Sathoual to send him some shells, promising in exchange a few pieces
of iron. The captain gave him the sheet of paper, the original of which
is in my possession, and is in red characters. The figure at the top of
the letter was placed there as the bearer of compliments: the branch
under him is the type of peace and amity: the marks in the column on the
left hand indicate the sort of shells the Carolinian had sent to M.
Martinez. In the column on the right, are placed the objects he desired
in exchange; namely, three large fishing hooks, four small ones, two
pieces of iron of the shape of axes, and two pieces a little longer.”
This curiously-expressed request was gratified, and many handsome shells
obtained in return.

This is, perhaps, as clear an instance as can be found, of the mode in
which an unlettered people would endeavour to convey the expression of
their wishes to their friends at a distance, and forms a striking
contrast to the elegant though complicated process of our own method of
writing.

In the written language of the Chinese, a great proof of its having
originated in this picture-writing, may yet be seen by a little
attention to the forms of their characters, and is, perhaps, the only
language now generally in practice, in which these early symbols are
discernible, though some have attempted to explain the Hebrew language
in the same way, by maintaining that the letters composing the Alphabet
were at first characters or drawings of things. In the modern Chinese,
however, much of the early rude formation of the characters has been
altered, arising, probably, in some degree, from a greater improvement
in taste inducing the nation to alter these rough to more elegant forms,
and partly from the facility of writing requiring the scribe, in some
cases, to strike off, and in others to connect, various parts of the
original figure. Thus, the present Chinese character for ‘a man,’ is
[Illustration] which was originally drawn [Illustration] or
[Illustration] or [Illustration]; here it is plain that, by lopping
off some of the limbs of this rude representative of the human species,
we leave something like the form of the present character, though it
would appear, that a long succession of ages must have polished the
rough material to the improved shape which it now possesses. Again, the
character to denote ‘the ear,’ was formerly drawn [Illustration] which
is now softened into the present form, thus [Illustration]. ‘A range of
hills,’ or ‘mound,’ at first drawn [Illustration] has now become
[Illustration]. ‘The sun,’ [Illustration] is now [Illustration]. The
reader’s ingenuity may be exercised and amused, and he will be enabled
to see how far the preceding remarks are well-grounded, if we present
him with a few of the original drawings, placed side by side with the
characters into which they have been gradually altered, and which are
now in general use.

The numbers one, two, three, and four, remain the same, being the
simplest form which can be devised, to maintain the connexion of the
drawing with the idea conceived. [Illustration] One, [Illustration]

       Ancient form.                          Present character.

       [Illustration]        the teeth.        [Illustration]

In order to save a multiplicity of characters, a single one is often
placed in various positions, to convey ideas which it would be very
difficult, and often impossible, to express by a simple drawing of the
object: for instance, how could the idea of ‘a corpse’ be represented on
paper; the figure of a man, it is easily seen, is not sufficient, since
we cannot tell, from looking at a picture so unfinished as the rapidity
of writing would demand, whether the breath be in or out of the body;
they, therefore, take the figure for man we have before seen, and lay it
prostrate, thus [Illustration]. The figure to represent a rock
[Illustration] is supposed to imply a rock jutting over, and affording
shelter, and from this was formed the following to denote ‘a stone,’
[Illustration], that is, as it were, a portion cut out of the rock;
hence, to imply a heap of stones, the form [Illustration] would readily
suggest itself. On the same principle it would be very difficult to
describe hail in a sketch; but, by considering it (if we may be allowed
the term) as hardened water, they add to the character denoting rain the
appearance of solid drops falling; thus, ‘rain’ is expressed by
[Illustration] and ‘hail’ thus [Illustration]. In representing the
forms of animals, or things, no further accomplishment was necessary
than accuracy of eye, and skill in delineating the various shapes; but
much greater ingenuity is required in order to represent intangible or
invisible substances, such as light, air, &c., or the qualities of
things which we call by the term adjectives, such as those implying
strength, weakness, or various actions, as to walk, to stop, to eat, to
desire, &c., in fact, all kinds of verbs. This difficult matter is
generally accomplished by the union of two or more simple forms, placed
together in such a way, that their combination may suggest the idea
required. To express brightness, the figures of the ‘sun’ and ‘moon’ are
placed together [Illustration]. In the character which they employ to
denote the adjective ‘aspiring,’ a man’s breath is represented as going
out of the body and ascending [Illustration]. To hanker after or desire
earnestly, is represented by this character of breath combined with
water, corresponding, in fact, with our somewhat common phrase
‘mouth-watering’ [Illustration]. The rather difficult character of a
king is described by ‘one,’ [Illustration]; and the character for land
[Illustration], or united [Illustration], implying the feudal idea of
sovereignty, all the land belonging to one. The adverbs ‘above’ and
‘below’ are very simply expressed, the former being [Illustration], and
the latter [Illustration]. Crafty and intriguing finds its
corresponding character in the little crooked symbol [Illustration].
The idea of a family is very happily and prettily expressed by the
symbol of a ‘house,’ under which three human beings are sheltered
[Illustration]. Many more instances, and some very remarkable ones,
might be adduced of this mode of representing complex ideas, by the
union of two or more characters for simple objects. In fact, most of the
words, perhaps, in common use in Chinese writing, might be divided, and
subdivided, till the original simple ideas had been traced out, and the
reason of their formation distinctly shown; but the progress of time and
refinement, has so moulded and altered even the most simple characters
in the language, that considerable research would be required to perform
such a task so many ages after their original formation. The inventor of
this species of writing amongst this singular nation is said to be
Tsang-hëĕ, of whom tradition or invention has preserved the portrait;
and, in order to convey to the mind of the spectator some idea of his
depth of intellect, and extent of mental vision, they have expressly

                                                                 S. B.




                             INTEMPERANCE.


The histories of all nations show that, in the infancy of society, man
has few wants. Food for the sustenance of life, clothing for the
covering of his person, and a habitation to shelter him from the wind
and the storm, form the chief objects of his desire; and these he is
easily enabled to supply from the rich storehouse of nature, which the
bountiful Creator has furnished for his use. The earth has never ceased
to reward the industry of man; and his daily necessities being thus
provided for, his future worldly wants occupy but a small share of his
thoughts.

As mankind multiply and associate together in cities and towns, their
attention is directed to other means of procuring the necessaries of
life. Trade, manufactures, and commerce offer ample opportunities for
the exercise of talent and industry; and the simplicity and contentment
of rural life are exchanged for a more artificial state of society. The
accumulation of property henceforth becomes an object of general
pursuit, and the busy mind of man is occupied in forming and digesting
plans to ensure such a result. Should prosperity attend his
undertakings, and crown his labours with increase, he will not be slow
in acquiring a taste for additional comfort and enjoyment, which his
improved circumstances have placed within his reach. Thus the wants of
man increase with his means of satisfying them. They are no longer
confined to the simple necessaries of life, but embrace those elegancies
and luxuries which owe their origin to the increase of wealth, the
refinement of education, and the intercourse of society. Surplus capital
thus finds ample and ready means of occupation in ministering to the
growing wants of the community. Various trades, arts and professions are
introduced, which open up new sources of employment; a stimulus is given
to industry, and the powers of the mind are brought into operation to
diffuse information and instruction through the land. Thus national
wealth, education, and refinement advance together; and the riches which
found entrance in one direction, find their way, through various
channels, to every ramification of society, as the blood which flows
from the heart circulates through every part of the human system.

So long as surplus wealth thus extends, and promotes a nation’s
prosperity, it is legitimately employed. But there are certain limits
within which it ought to be confined. The morality, intelligence, and
industry of the people are the bulwarks of national greatness; and if,
by the introduction of any article of luxury or common diet, these
barriers are weakened or thrown down, and the flood-gates of immorality,
ignorance, and idleness opened, their dark tide will begin to flow, and
threaten the best interests of the country. This result is shown by the
histories of all those nations which reached the summit of wealth and
power by the exercise of temperance, and whose downfall was hastened by
their intemperance, producing idle and licentious habits, discord,
effeminacy, and a spirit of dependence. Such were the Persians, the
Greeks, and the Romans.

Though there are distinctions of rank and station in society, there is a
mutual dependence throughout the community at large, similar to the
connexion existing among the members of the human body. “The eye cannot
say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I
have no need of you.” The man whom wealth has exempted from the common
lot of humanity, “in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,” is as
dependent on the cultivator of the soil, the manufacturer, and the
mechanic, as they are upon him. Hence all in their several stations are
equally the guardians of the peace, happiness, and prosperity of the
nation to which they belong; and it becomes both their duty and their
interest, either to prevent the introduction of any traffic of an
injurious character, or to expel that from the land which may have been
found to have such a tendency.

The facility with which ardent spirits are obtained in this country,
cannot but be regarded as the cause of those habits of intemperance
which deface the fair page of our moral history. Drunkenness prevails to
a lamentable extent throughout the land, and is the fruitful source of
idleness, poverty, immorality, and crime. So far from being diminished,
it seems rather on the increase; and the fearful change which it has
wrought in the character of our artisans and labouring population, calls
for the adoption of some measure to arrest its course.

Ardent spirits are destructive of health, property, and morals; unfit to
be used by persons in health, being destitute of any nutritious quality;
and the traffic in them is injurious to the prosperity of the country.
Besides the misery which the use of them inflicts on individuals and
families, it greatly augments the national expenditure. It increases the
poor’s rates by increasing pauperism; it enhances the expense of
judicial proceedings by promoting crime; and our hospitals and lunatic
asylums are indebted to the same cause for by far the greater proportion
of their wretched inmates. If the money wasted in the purchase of this
worse than useless superfluity, were spent on articles of real utility,
a stimulus would be given to trade, manufactures, and commerce.

Such being the consequences of the traffic in ardent spirits, as proved
by incontrovertible evidence, the welfare of the nation calls for its
suppression. This must be accomplished, not by an appeal to the
legislature for an Act of Parliament to abolish the trade, but by
enlightened public opinion. If the community be convinced of the noxious
qualities of ardent spirit, and the vicious and immoral consequences to
which habits of drinking lead, they will cease to buy, and the traffic
must come to an end. But this object cannot be attained till the nation
rise as one man to crush this enemy to its happiness. This is the result
which the institutions called TEMPERANCE SOCIETIES aim to accomplish.
The means they employ is simply the diffusion of information through the
land, with a view to correct public opinion, and unite men and women in
the practice of total abstinence from distilled spirits as an article of
ordinary use. They act upon the well-established maxim that prevention
is better than cure; and their first solicitation is to gain the
countenance and support of the sober, temperate, respectable, and
influential classes of the community, whose combined example may operate
upon the mass of the population. Such being their principle and object,
they deserve the support and assistance of every friend to humanity and
every lover of his country.

as a steel; either of them may hammer on wood for ever, no fire will

To this little fish we are said to be indebted for one of the grandest
and most useful inventions since the world began. It is thus
described:—It swims on the surface of the sea, on the back of its shell,
which exactly resembles the hull of a ship; it raises two feet like
masts, and extends a membrane between, which serves as a sail; the other
two feet are employed as oars. This fish is usually found in the
Mediterranean.




                          A DEVONSHIRE SKETCH.
             BY THE LATE REV. JOHN MARRIOTT, OF BROADCLYST


       Ye green hills of Devon! I love to look o’er ye;
         The glow of your verdure refreshes my sight!
       In the wild and majestic let Westmoreland glory;
         But yours is the palm of more tranquil delight.

       Not that robes of rich beauty, in which Nature dresses
         Her features of boldness, your limits disown;
       To him who could deem so, deep Lymouth’s recesses,
         And Dart’s rocky borders, must all be unknown.

       But your own proper boast is the Combe, neatly rounded,
         Which preserves through all seasons its emerald hue;
       Whilst the dews, o’er the uplands by which it is bounded,
         Impart, in soft contrast, the mist’s tender blue;

       Not deserted, though lonely: the vale in its centre,
         Girt with Barn and rough Linhay, encloses a farm;
       And o’er the warm nook of its deepest indenture,
         The orchard’s fair bloom sheds its fugitive charm.

       An eye little used to such leafy profusion,
         Might fancy yon hedge-row one wide-waving wood;
       And furze and plumed fern, as to aid the illusion,
         Here and there on the tameness of culture intrude.

       But wildest the mixture of shrub, bush, and bramble,
         And sweetest the scent which the wild flowers breathe,
       Where the birchen-banks mark the stream’s devious ramble,
         And the ear drinks its musical murmurs beneath.

       How soothing the sense of serenity stealing
         O’er the mind, whilst on plenty and peace thus we gaze!
       Less grateful, perhaps, though more lively, the feeling
         Awaken’d by prospects that awe and amaze.

       If in those we acknowledge the symbols of greatness;
         If earth’s pillars its Maker’s omnipotence prove;
       In these let us hail Him, “whose clouds distil fatness,”
         And who crowneth the year with his goodness and love.




               THE MOCKING-BIRD. (_Turdus polyglottus._)


The Mocking-bird is a species of thrush, not uncommon in many parts both
of North and South America and the West India Islands. In size, it does
not exceed the European song-bird, and perhaps is not equal to it in the
beauty of its plumage; it is, however, far from being an inelegant
creature, but it is better known for the peculiarity and amazing power
of its voice. Although not gifted with any powerful weapons of
self-defence, these birds display extraordinary courage in defence of
their eggs and young, and will fearlessly attack any animal which may
approach their haunts, even their greatest enemy, a species of black
snake.

“To these qualities” (says Wilson, the American author), “we may add
that of a voice full, strong, and musical, and capable of almost every
modulation, from the clear mellow tones of the wood-thrush, to the
savage scream of the bald-eagle. In measure and accent, he faithfully
follows his originals. In force and sweetness of expression, he greatly
exceeds them. In his native groves, mounted on the top of a tall bush,
or half-grown tree, in the dawn of dewy morning, while the woods are
already vocal with a multitude of warblers, his admirable song rises
pre-eminent over every competitor. The ear can listen to his music
alone, to which that of all the others seems a mere accompaniment.
Neither is this strain altogether imitative. His own native notes, which
are easily distinguishable by such as are well acquainted with those of
our various song-birds, are bold and full, and varied seemingly beyond
all limits. His expanded wings and tail, glistening with white, and the
buoyant gaiety of his action, arresting the eye as his song most
irresistibly does the ear, he sweeps round with enthusiastic ecstacy. He
mounts or descends as his song swells or dies away. While thus exerting
himself, a bystander, destitute of sight, would suppose that the whole
feathered tribes, had assembled together on a trial of skill, each
striving to produce his utmost effect; so perfect are his imitations. He
many times deceives the sportsman, and sends him in search of birds that
perhaps are not within miles of him, but whose notes he exactly
imitates; even birds themselves are frequently imposed on by this
admirable mimic, and are decoyed by the fancied calls of their mates, or
dive with precipitation into the depths of thickets, at the scream of
what they suppose to be the sparrow-hawk.

[Illustration: THE MOCKING BIRD.]

“The mocking-bird loses little of the power and energy of his song by
confinement. In his domesticated state, when he commences his career of
song, it is impossible to stand by uninterested. He whistles for the
dog—Cæsar starts up, wags his tail, and runs to meet his master; he
squeaks out like a hurt chicken—and the hen hurries about, with hanging
wings and bristled feathers, clucking to protect its injured brood. The
barking of the dog, the mewing of the cat, the creaking of a passing
wheelbarrow, follow, with great truth and rapidity. He repeats the tune
taught him by his master, though of considerable length, fully and
faithfully. He runs over the quiverings of the canary and the clear
whistlings of the Virginia nightingale, or the redbird, with such
superior execution and effect, that the mortified songsters feel their
own inferiority and become altogether silent, while he seems to triumph
in their defeat by redoubling his exertions.

“Both in his native and domesticated state, during the solemn stillness
of night, as soon as the moon rises in silent majesty, he begins his
delightful solo; and serenades us the livelong night, with a full
display of his vocal powers, making the whole neighbourhood ring with
his inimitable melody.”

A lover of natural history cannot I think be a bad man, as the very
study of it tends to promote a calmness and serenity of mind, favourable
to the reception of grateful and holy thoughts of the great and good
Parent of the universe. He cannot be a cruel man, because he will be
unwilling wantonly to destroy even an insect, when he perceives how
exquisitively each of them is contrived, and how curiously it is made
for the station it is destined to fill in the animal world.—JESSE.

Many methods have been suggested for saving life in cases of accidents
on the water: the following was stated to me as an experiment actually
made by the relater; he had thus supported himself in the sea, at
Plymouth, for twenty minutes, and could have done it much longer. As
danger of overturning or of sinking appears, have your hat in readiness,
and place it under your chin, holding it with your hands in the same
position upon the water as on the head. The air in the crown will
prevent the water from rising, and is sufficient to keep the whole head
above water.

     ST. SWITHIN’S DAY.—See _Saturday Magazine_, vol. i., p. 14.

1685 Execution of _Duke of Monmouth_, after his defeat at Sedgemoor.

1815 _Napoleon_ went on board the British ship Bellerephon, Captain
     Maitland, after his defeat at Waterloo.

1817 Died, at Paris, the _Baroness de Staël_, the daughter of M. Necker,
     and author of several political works, which enjoyed considerable
     popularity while the events of the French Revolution, with which
     the name of M. Necker is so intimately connected, were recent. Her
     works evince much knowledge of the human heart.

                               TUESDAY, 16th.

 622 On this day the _flight_ of the impostor, Mohammed, from Mecca,
     took place, and from it his followers date the events of their
     history. This epoch is called, from the Arabic word, which
     signifies _to fly_, or _to leave one’s country_, the _Hegira_.

1377 _Richard II._, only child of Edward the Black Prince, was crowned
     at Westminster. He did not inherit the warlike genius or the
     talents of his father and grandfather, but seems to have been of a
     mild, amiable disposition, and may truly be said, in the words of
     Shakspeare, to have been “a man more sinned against than sinning.”

1546 _Ann Askew_, a young lady of great merit and beauty, (connected
     with most of the ladies of the court, and with the Queen, Catharine
     Parr,) was burned at Smithfield, for denying the doctrine of the
     real presence.

1800 Died, at his seat near Southampton, _Bryan Edwards_, the Author of
     the _History of the West Indies_.

                              WEDNESDAY, 17th.

1674 The remains of the two Princes, _Edward V. and his Brother_, were
     discovered in the Tower, and, by order of Charles II., removed to
     Westminster Abbey.

1761 _Peter III._, husband of Catherine II., was murdered. The
     unfortunate Emperor was strangled with a towel, and the next day
     his body was exposed to the populace, and his death attributed to
     that disease we now call cholera.

                               THURSDAY, 18th.

 371 B. C. The Battle of Leuctra, in which the Lacedemonians were
     defeated, and their general, Cleombrotus, slain.

1100 Death of _Godfrey de Bouillon_, the most celebrated leader among
     the princes and nobles who went on the first crusade: when
     Jerusalem was taken, he was unanimously chosen king.

1374 _Petrarch_, one of the earliest, as well as the most elegant, among
     the Italian poets, whose romantic attachment to the beautiful Laura
     has rendered his name familiar, even to those who are wholly
     ignorant of Italian literature, was found dead in his library on
     the seventieth anniversary of his birth.

1796 _Louis XVIII._ compelled to leave the army of the emigrants, and
     place himself in the hands of the Austrians.

1812 A Treaty of Peace between England and Sweden was signed at Ærebo.

                                FRIDAY, 19th.

 365 B. C. Rome was taken and pillaged by the Gauls, who put to the
     sword the senators and old men, who alone remained in the city.

  64 _Nero_, for his amusement, caused Rome to be set on fire in various
     places. This conflagration was attributed by him to the Christians,
     and all who could not escape or conceal themselves, were put to
     death with the most cruel torments, among others, St. Peter and St.
     Paul suffered martyrdom.

1333 The Battle of Halidown Hill, in which the Scots were defeated by
     Edward III.

1588 The Spanish Armada arrived in the British Channel. This formidable
     fleet consisted of 130 vessels, carrying 2630 pieces of brass
     cannon. It was fitted out by Philip II. of Spain, and blessed by a
     special nuncio from the Pope. Its approach spread terror and
     dismay; but Elizabeth took advantage of the panic to excite her
     subjects to defend their country without draining her exchequer,
     and while nobles and citizens fitted out ships at their own charge,
     the lower orders flocked to man the vessels and defend the coasts.
     The armada, however was dispersed by a tempest, and, while still in
     disorder, attacked by the English under Lord Effingham, and
     compelled to seek safety in flight.

                               SATURDAY, 20th.

1620 A massacre of the Protestants in the Valteline, a fertile valley of
     Switzerland.

1819 Died, at Edinburgh, _John Playfair_, a celebrated mathematician and
     geographer.

                                SUNDAY, 21st.

     SEVENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY.

1403 Battle of Shrewsbury. In this engagement the Prince of Wales,
     afterwards Henry V., made his first essay in arms. The death of
     Henry Percy, bettor known as Hotspur, made this battle still more
     memorable.

1683 The execution of Lord Russell, for high treason, took place in
     Lincoln’s Inn Fields.

1704 Taking of Gibraltar by the English.

1796 Died, at Dumfries, in his thirty-eighth year, _Robert Burns_, the
     poet.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
