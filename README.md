# Comparative case study of Patricia Tries and Hybrid Tries

In  this  case  study  we  will  be  comparing  the  performances  of  two  Trie  datastructures : *Patricia  Tries*,  and  *Hybrid  Tries*  (also  known  as  Ternary  SearchTries).

 We have chosen to implement both Patricia Tries and Hybrid Tries in Java.
This  decision  relies  on  reasons  of  performance,  ease  of  memory  management, powerful standard library and last but not least our familiarity with the language.
In order to ease the comprehension, all our functions are well documented.

All of our benchmarks can be found in the `dump` directory.
